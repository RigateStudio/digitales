# Final project THP : DigiTales

## 📋 C O N T E X T :

We have told you that a website under construction can allow you to submit a fictional idea to authors, illustrators, editors to change a franchise just like Star Wars while being financed through crowdfunding. 

## 📋 P E R S O N A | U S E R :

You are not scared of bugs, you want to end up like J.K Rowling, being produced like a Pixar movie, while directly speaking to artists and financing your idea through crowdfunding.

The V1 version is online. The V2 version is still under construction.
